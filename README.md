This app is an open source version of the Style Judging app for [LudoSport](https://www.ludosport.net), as used by the Style Judges under the supervision of [LudoSport INCOM](https://www.ludosportincom.org)

The encoding algorithm and UX are based on the original app and the documentation provided [here](https://github.com/anfive/style-codes)

The main objective of this repo is to have an available base to be able to create alternative apps for new judging formats and testing them.
